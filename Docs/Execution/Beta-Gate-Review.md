## Automated Validation Summary

- `swift test --package-path Packages` — pass
- `swift test --package-path Apps` — pass
- `./scripts/atlas/full-acceptance.sh` — pass
- `./scripts/atlas/run-ui-automation.sh` — pass on a machine with Accessibility trust (`4` UI tests, including language switching)
- `./scripts/atlas/verify-dmg-install.sh` — pass
- `./scripts/atlas/verify-app-launch.sh` — pass
- `./scripts/atlas/package-native.sh` — pass

## Beta Assessment

### Product Functionality

- Core frozen MVP workflows are complete end to end.
- Recovery-first behavior is visible in both Smart Clean and Apps flows.
- Physical on-disk restore is currently limited to recovery items that carry a supported restore path; older or unstructured records may still be model-only restore.
- Settings and permission refresh flows are functional.
- The app now defaults to `简体中文` and supports switching to `English` through persisted settings.

### Packaging and Installability

- `.app`, `.zip`, `.dmg`, and `.pkg` artifacts are produced successfully.
- Native packaging has been rerun successfully after the localization work.
- DMG installation into `~/Applications/Atlas for Mac.app` is validated.
- Installed app launch is validated.

### Test Coverage

- Shared package tests are green.
- App-layer tests are green.
- Native UI smoke is green on a machine with Accessibility trust.
- Manual beta checklist and SOP are now present for human validation.

## Blockers

- Public signed/notarized distribution is still blocked by missing Apple release credentials:
  - `Developer ID Application`
  - `Developer ID Installer`
  - `ATLAS_NOTARY_PROFILE`

## Decision

- `Pass with Conditions`

## Conditions

- Internal beta / trusted-user beta can proceed with the current ad hoc-signed local artifacts.
- Recovery and execution copy must stay explicit about supported restore paths and unsupported cleanup targets during internal beta.
- Public beta or broad external distribution must wait until signing and notarization credentials are available and the release packaging path is re-run.

## Follow-up Actions

- Obtain Apple signing and notarization credentials.
- Re-run `./scripts/atlas/signing-preflight.sh`.
- Re-run `./scripts/atlas/package-native.sh` with signing/notarization environment variables.
- Validate signed DMG / PKG install behavior on a clean machine.
